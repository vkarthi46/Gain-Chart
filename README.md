# Gain-Chart

Let’s look at scenario, let say you are data scientist for a store which sells clothes. Your store has total of 100,000 customers’. You know that, based on your experience, whenever you sent an offer-email to all your customers. Approximately 10% of them respondent and purchase the product. What you think, will happen if we sent to 20,000 customers. How many do you think will respondent? And this is the random sample and we know about 10% will respondent. Would say 2,000 will respondent. Far enough right, if we sent to 40,000 customers would say 4,000 60,000 -6000, 80,000-8000, 10,000-10000.this is the random selection process .here we can draw a line which actually represent random selection. Slope of the line equal to 10% respondent if we sent them out mail. Now the question here is can we somehow improve the more customer to respondent when we sent out a mail. Can we somehow target our customers more appropriately to get better respondent. How about instead of sending out random sample of customers, we pick and choose the customers we sent this offer mail to. How do we pick and choose? Let’s build a model, basically a customer segmentation model ,which we are going to predict they purchase or not ,we can take a group of customers before we send out offer and look back and see who made a purchase, whether male or female , which country were they in ,what age predominantly were they, were they browsing on mobile or computer all of these factors , we can take them into account and measure them and build logistic regression and get a model which will help us to assess the likelihood of certain type of customers purchasing based on their characteristics. Once we build this model how about apply it. Model will tell us something like.Rank our customers and give them a probability to purchasing a product .we can use that probability to contact our customers. Let say if we contact 20,000...will probably get a much higher response compared to random contact.bcaz we are picking out the customers which are having highest risk of accepting our offers. We know from previous behavior of customers similar to them that they have 90% or 80% chance of purchasing the product. And we will go for them first. And we will put them in top list of customers who contact. Then we contact 40,000 our response will higher when compared to 4000 which we get it from random sample. If our models really good then by the time we are 60,000 we will get almost 8000 or 9000 customers who responding. We are already contacted pretty much everyone. If you want to contact more, if we sent out 80,000, ll getting even closer 10,000 thousand responses. Now we just draw the line, u can get Cumulative accuracy profile of your model and as you can imagine, better the model, the area between the two lines ll increase when your models get better. If worst then, then both lines are closer. And let say you are running another models and plot it...and therefore by plotting the GAIN chart, u ll be able to compare models each other and understand how much gain you get in each of these models compared to the random models. Or how much additional gain u gets from switching from one model to another model. Since ur improving hit ratio and therefore u improving ur Return on Investments. This is how we are going to asses our models.
